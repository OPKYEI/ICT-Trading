## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ICT-ML-Trading.git
cd ICT-ML-Trading
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install MetaTrader5 (for MT5 brokers)

```bash
pip install MetaTrader5
```

Note: MT5 package only works on Windows. For Linux/Mac, use only API-based brokers like OANDA.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1. Broker Setup

Edit `src/utils/config.py`:

```python
# OANDA (API-based)
OANDA_API_TOKEN = "your-oanda-api-token"
OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID = "your-account-id"
OANDA_ENV = "practice"  # or "live"

# FTMO (MT5-based)
FTMO_MT5_TERMINAL = r"C:\Program Files\FTMO Global Markets MT5 Terminal\terminal64.exe"
FTMO_MT5_LOGIN = 123456
FTMO_MT5_PASSWORD = "your-password"
FTMO_MT5_SERVER = "FTMO-Demo"

# Pepperstone (MT5-based)
PEPPERSTONE_MT5_TERMINAL = r"C:\Pepperstone MetaTrader 5\terminal64.exe"
PEPPERSTONE_MT5_LOGIN = 789012
PEPPERSTONE_MT5_PASSWORD = "your-password"
PEPPERSTONE_MT5_SERVER = "Pepperstone-Demo"

# Active brokers
BROKERS = ["OANDA", "FTMO", "PEPPERSTONE"]

# Instruments to trade
SYMBOLS = ["EUR_USD", "GBP_USD", "XAU_USD", "US30_USD", "NAS100_USD"]
```

### 2. Risk Management

```python
# Position sizing
units = 1000  # 0.01 lots for MT5, adjust as needed

# Optional TP/SL
USE_TP_SL = False  # Set to True to use fixed TP/SL
TAKE_PROFIT_PIPS = 50
STOP_LOSS_PIPS = 25
```

### 3. MT5 Terminal Setup

For MT5 brokers (FTMO, Pepperstone):
1. Install MT5 terminal from broker
2. Enable automated trading: Tools → Options → Expert Advisors → Allow automated trading
3. Login to your demo/live account
4. Keep terminal open while running the bot

## 📊 Data Preparation

### 1. Historical Data Format

Place CSV files in `data/` folder with format:
```
timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume
2024-01-01 00:00:00,1.0950,1.0955,1.0945,1.0952,1250
```

### 2. Download from Dukascopy

1. Visit [Dukascopy Historical Data](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/)
2. Select instrument and date range
3. Download as CSV
4. Place in `data/` folder as `SYMBOL_60m.csv`

## 🚂 Training Models

### 1. First-Time Training (5-6 hours)

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

This will:
- Load and align multi-timeframe data
- Engineer 50+ ICT features
- Train multiple models with nested CV
- Save best model to `checkpoints/`
- Generate performance reports in `reports/`

### 2. Using Pre-trained Models

If training was completed before, models are loaded from checkpoints automatically.

## 🤖 Live Trading

### 1. Start Trading Bot

```bash
python live_trade_multiinstrument.py
```

**Important**: We recommend using the improved version with 5-bar window logic:

```bash
python live_trade_multiinstrument_improved.py
```

The improved bot includes:
- **5-Bar Window Logic**: Trades are held for exactly 5 hours (matching ML model's prediction window)
- **State Persistence**: Survives restarts without duplicate trades
- **Smart Entry Validation**: Prevents chasing extended moves after restarts
- **Automatic Position Management**: Closes trades after 5 hours automatically

See [TRADING_LOGIC.md](docs/TRADING_LOGIC.md) for detailed explanation.

### 2. How It Works

The bot will:
- Load the best model from checkpoints
- Connect to all configured brokers
- Fetch latest market data every hour at :01
- Generate signals based on 5-bar forward prediction
- Execute trades with proper window management
- Maintain state in `trade_state.json`
- Log all activities to `logs/live_trade.log`

### 3. Monitor Performance

- Check broker terminals for executed trades
- Review `logs/live_trade.log` for detailed execution info
- Monitor `trade_state.json` for active positions
- Verify 5-hour automatic closures

### 4. Stop Trading

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the bot gracefully. State is preserved for restart.

## 📈 Backtesting

Backtesting is integrated into the training pipeline. Results include:
- Equity curve visualization
- Maximum drawdown analysis
- Trade-by-trade performance
- Sharpe ratio and other metrics

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### MT5 Connection Issues

**Error**: "IPC timeout"
- Ensure MT5 terminal is running and logged in
- Enable "Algo Trading" button (should be green)
- Check Tools → Options → Expert Advisors settings
- Run as Administrator if needed

### Symbol Not Found

**Error**: "Symbol XYZ not found"
- Check exact symbol name in MT5 Market Watch
- Update symbol mapping in executor classes
- Some brokers use different naming (e.g., "US30" vs "US30.cash")

### Multiple MT5 Instances

The system handles multiple MT5 connections automatically by:
- Reinitializing connection for each broker
- Proper connection cleanup between trades
- Automatic retry on connection failure

### Missing Data

**Error**: "Insufficient data"
- Ensure CSV files have at least 120 bars
- Check data format matches expected columns
- Verify timestamp format is correct

## 🎯 ICT Concepts Implemented

- **Market Structure**: Identifies swing highs/lows, trends, and structure shifts
- **Order Blocks**: Last opposing candle before aggressive move
- **Fair Value Gaps**: Price inefficiencies in 3-candle patterns
- **Breaker Blocks**: Failed order blocks that reverse
- **Liquidity Concepts**: Buy/Sell-side liquidity, stop runs
- **Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)**: 62-79% Fibonacci retracement zones
- **Power of 3**: Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution phases
- **Kill Zones**: High-probability time windows for trades

## ⚡ Performance Tips

1. **VPS Deployment**: Run on a VPS near broker servers for lower latency
2. **Resource Allocation**: Close unnecessary programs during training
3. **Data Quality**: Use high-quality tick data for better features
4. **Model Selection**: XGBoost typically performs best
5. **Position Sizing**: Start small and scale up gradually

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
3. **Enable 2FA** on all broker accounts
4. **Monitor account activity** regularly
5. **Set maximum position limits** with brokers
