## Overview

ICT (Inner Circle Trader) methodology focuses on understanding how institutional traders operate in the forex market. The core premise is that large institutions need liquidity to fill their orders, and they engineer market movements to access this liquidity.

### Key Principles

1. **Smart Money**: Large institutions that move markets
2. **Retail Patterns**: Predictable behavior of retail traders
3. **Liquidity Hunting**: Institutions target retail stop losses
4. **Time & Price**: Specific times when institutions are active

## Market Structure

### Swing Points

The foundation of ICT analysis starts with identifying market structure through swing highs and lows.

```
Swing High (SH): A high with lower highs on both sides
    H
   / \
  L   L

Swing Low (SL): A low with higher lows on both sides
  H   H
   \ /
    L
```

### Market Structure Types

**Bullish Structure**:
- Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL)
- Indicates upward momentum
- Smart money accumulating longs

**Bearish Structure**:
- Lower Highs (LH) and Lower Lows (LL)
- Indicates downward momentum
- Smart money distributing/shorting

**Ranging Structure**:
- Equal highs and lows
- Accumulation or distribution phase
- Prepare for breakout

### Market Structure Shift (MSS)

A MSS occurs when:
- In uptrend: Price breaks below the most recent Higher Low
- In downtrend: Price breaks above the most recent Lower High

This indicates potential trend reversal and is a high-probability entry signal.

### Break of Structure (BOS)

Continuation pattern where:
- In uptrend: Price breaks above previous High
- In downtrend: Price breaks below previous Low

## PD Arrays (Premium/Discount Arrays)

PD Arrays are price levels or zones where institutional orders are likely placed.

### Order Blocks (OB)

The last opposite candle before an aggressive price movement:

**Bullish OB**: Last bearish candle before strong upward move
```
    ↑↑↑ (aggressive up)
  ▼ (this bearish candle is the OB)
  ▼
```

**Bearish OB**: Last bullish candle before strong downward move

**Trading Logic**:
- Price often returns to test these levels
- Institutions have pending orders here
- High probability reversal zones

### Fair Value Gaps (FVG)

A three-candle pattern showing price inefficiency:

```
Candle 1: |-------|
Candle 2:           |-----------|  (gap between C1 high and C3 low)
Candle 3:                   |-------|
```

**Characteristics**:
- Shows imbalanced price action
- Acts as magnet for future price
- Often filled before trend continues

### Breaker Blocks

Failed Order Blocks that break through:
1. Bullish OB fails → becomes resistance
2. Bearish OB fails → becomes support

**Identification**:
- OB that price closes through
- Role reversal from support to resistance (or vice versa)
- Strong rejection on retest

### Mitigation Blocks

Areas where previous OB imbalance is "mitigated":
- Price returns to OB origin
- Fills inefficiency
- Continues in original direction

## Liquidity Concepts

### Buy-Side/Sell-Side Liquidity (BSL/SSL)

**Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL)**:
- Resting above swing highs
- Where buy stops and breakout orders sit
- Target for bearish manipulation

**Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL)**:
- Resting below swing lows
- Where sell stops and breakdown orders sit
- Target for bullish manipulation

### Liquidity Pools

Clusters of liquidity where multiple highs/lows align:
- Equal highs/lows
- Trendline liquidity
- Round number liquidity

### Stop Runs

Intentional price movements to trigger stop losses:
1. Price spikes to take out stops
2. Immediate reversal
3. Trap retail traders

**Identification**:
- Spike through obvious level
- Quick reversal
- Volume spike

## Time-Based Concepts

### Trading Sessions

**Asian Session** (11 PM - 8 AM GMT):
- Range formation
- Accumulation phase
- Sets daily range

**London Session** (7 AM - 4 PM GMT):
- Manipulation phase
- False breakouts common
- Sets direction

**New York Session** (12 PM - 9 PM GMT):
- Distribution phase
- True direction revealed
- Continuation or reversal

### Kill Zones

High-probability trading windows:

**London Kill Zone**: 7:00 - 10:00 AM GMT
- Most volatile
- Initial manipulation

**New York Kill Zone**: 12:00 - 3:00 PM GMT
- Second chance entry
- Trend confirmation

### Power of 3 (Daily Model)

Daily price action follows three phases:

1. **Accumulation** (Asian): Build positions
2. **Manipulation** (London Open): Fake move
3. **Distribution** (NY): Real move

### Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)

Fibonacci-based entry zone:
- 62% to 79% retracement
- Of previous swing
- In trending market

## Advanced Patterns

### Turtle Soup Pattern

Failed breakout pattern:
1. Break above/below 20-day high/low
2. Immediate failure and reversal
3. Targets opposite liquidity

### Judas Swing

False move during London session:
1. Push in wrong direction
2. Take out overnight stops
3. Reverse for true daily direction

### Market Maker Models

**Buy Model**:
1. Sell-side liquidity taken
2. Market structure shift
3. Bullish PD array forms
4. Displacement higher

**Sell Model**:
1. Buy-side liquidity taken
2. Market structure shift
3. Bearish PD array forms
4. Displacement lower

## ML Integration

### How Machine Learning Uses ICT Concepts

The ML models learn complex relationships between:

1. **Feature Combinations**:
   - OB + Time of day
   - FVG + Market structure
   - Liquidity levels + Session

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Identifies which ICT setups work best
   - Learns market-specific nuances
   - Adapts to changing conditions

3. **Probability Assignment**
